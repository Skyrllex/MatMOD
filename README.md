# MatMOD
Implementation of counting points in a rectangle using the bisection method and enumeration.

The enumeration method checks whether a point is less than or equal to the coordinates of the rectangle's boundaries.

The bisection method includes data preprocessing, where a matrix is ​​created based on the number of elements and filled depending on the border cells. When counting the number of points, the matrix cells corresponding to the rectangle's coordinates are taken and added together in a certain way.

The program contains an algorithm that:
⦁ Accepts a number entered by the user as input;
⦁ Based on the entered number, generates points and graphically displays them on a plane;
⦁ On this plane, the user draws a rectangle parallel to the coordinate axes, which the user can redraw if desired without changing the original data;
⦁ The program counts the number of points using two different methods, displaying the time it takes each algorithm to complete the task;

# INSTRUCTIONS
Enter the number of points. Click the done button. Points will be randomly displayed on the plane.
To draw a rectangle, click the mouse once on the starting point of the rectangle and once on the end point.
The number of points inside the rectangle and the time of calculation of the methods will be calculated.
To draw another rectangle with these data, simply draw it again.
Or enter the coordinates and click the button - done and the data will be updated.
